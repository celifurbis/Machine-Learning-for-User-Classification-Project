# Machine-Learning-for-User-Classification-Project
## Using Machine Learning to Classify Students and Predict Student Purchases

## Case Description

### Background:
In a machine learning classification problem, the algorithm assigns labels to instances based on their features. This Marchine Learning for User Classification project will allow you to apply this technique by utilizing an excerpert of our own data stripped of personally identifiable information. I will examine student engagement metrics, such as the number of days sutdents have spent on the platform, the minutes of watched content, and the number of courses they´ve started. You´ll then use this data to train several machine learning models, inlcuding logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, dcision trees, and random forests. The aim is to predict wether students would upgrade their free plan to a paid one.

### Business Objetive:
Such an analysis is of utmost importance for any online company. Predicting potencial customers can be used for advertisement targeting or reaching out with exclusive offers. This helps allocate a budget for users likely to benefit from the product, aiming to increase the company´s revenue.

### Note:
This classification problem deals with a heavily imbalance dataset, the number of students likely to keep their free plan exceeds the number predicted to purchase.

## Project requirements
I worked with Python for this Marchine Learning for User Classification project, wher you´ll need to prepare the following libraries:
  #pandas
